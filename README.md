# Android App README

Welcome to the Android App Project! This document will guide you through the steps to run the Android app project on your development environment. Before proceeding, please ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your machine.

## Prerequisites

To run the Android app project, you need the following tools and dependencies:

1. **Android Studio**: Download and install the latest stable version of Android Studio from the official website - [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Android development requires JDK 8 or later. You can download the JDK from Oracle's website - [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

3. **Android SDK**: Android Studio will install the necessary SDK, but you need to make sure it's updated to the latest version using the SDK Manager within Android Studio.

4. **Git**: If the project is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, you'll need Git to clone the repository. You can download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snehilrx/SampleApp
```

## Import Project in Android Studio

1. Launch Android Studio.

2. Click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen.

3. Navigate to the location where you cloned the project repository and select the project's root directory.

4. Click "OK" to import the project into Android Studio.

5. Android Studio will take some time to sync the project and download any required dependencies.

## Configure Emulator or Connect a Physical Device

1. **Emulator**: If you want to run the app on an emulator, follow these steps:
    - Open Android Studio.
    - Click on "AVD Manager" in the toolbar or go to `Tools > AVD Manager`.
    - Create a new Virtual Device by following the instructions in the AVD Manager.
    - Once the emulator is set up, select it from the AVD Manager and click "Run".

2. **Physical Device**: If you prefer to run the app on a physical Android device, enable USB debugging on your device and connect it to your computer using a USB cable.

## Build and Run the App

1. Make sure you have either an emulator running or a physical device connected to your computer.

2. In Android Studio, click the green "Run" button (usually a play icon) from the toolbar or go to `Run > Run 'app'`.

3. Android Studio will build the app and launch it on the selected emulator or physical device.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully set up and run the Android app project on your development environment. If everything went smoothly, you should see the app running on your emulator or physical device. Happy coding!
